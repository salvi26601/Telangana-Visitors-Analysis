# Telangana-Visitors-Analysis

This project intends to be a guide to increase Telangana's tourism industry. For this,
* I collected data from the official website, cleaned and preprocessed it to remove null values, blanks, poor data to get a proper file with only required data.
* Then, I created a PowerBI report which clearly distinguishes between domestic,i.e., in country tourists and foreign tourists in the State.

Page 1 - It depicts the state's Domestic Tourism from 2016 to 2022 for all months which can also be adjusted as per our view. It shows the CAGR(Compound Annual Growth Rate) which would indicate the rise and fall of tourism within the selected duration. For simplicity, I have shown the top and bottom districts and a comparison of all the major economic districts within Telangana.

Page 3 - It is a comparison report which defines and helps us visualize the overall growth and fall of toursim within the years. One main thing shown here is the projected domestic and foreign visitors in 2025 based on the CAGR for the selected duration. It will help the government to prepare well in advance and provide better hospitality and increase its tourism.

Page 4 - It shows a very interesting insight about Telangana's capital and one of the most important tourist cities which is Hyderabad. This report shows a comparison among all the months of the year and tells us about the peak and low seasons of Hyderabad toursim.
